title: The Most Expensive Spreadsheet I've Seen

The age of excess. We were at the end of a decade long economic boom. The
massive growth was underpinned by gigantic resource contracts. Mining start ups
were floated making their owners overnight *mining magnates*, without having
dug anything out of the ground. The median house price had tripled in some
capital cities, and engineering salaries had increased across the board.

In the midst of this, I was running an invited tender for an engineering firm.
We needed a way to forecast the cost of projects whose assets alone run
into the tens of millions of dollars. Three engineering consultancies submitted
bids, one bid in particular changed the way I see business forever.

### Just a Spreadsheet

This particular company met with me in person. A senior partner and an
engineering manager came to our head office in Melbourne to talk about the
tender.  They had already done this exact same job for another company in New
Zealand. Their forecasting tool was written a few years ago and was still used
today. Getting our job done was going to be low risk, because they already had
the expertise.  They had also worked on *so many engineering projects* that
they had access to very detailed historical cost information that could
populate our forecasting tool.

I was excited. Here was this large engineering firm that had taken the time
to visit, and had already done the job before. None of the other invited
companies saw us in person.

Then I read their proposal.

Their description, which spread over many pages, boiled down to a *spreadsheet* that
would be populated by a junior engineer, and checked off by the senior
engineer. They would not provide detailed costs to populate the
forecast and instead use some more generic ones they had access to. 

I was a little disappointed. 

Looking back, I am not sure what it was that I was expecting. But I thought that maybe
it would be something more permanent than a spreadsheet made by someone fresh out of uni.

But that isn't what changed my view of business forever. It was their price.

$200,000

Plus an amount equivalent to $60,000 per year to keep it up to date with the latest 
in industry trends.

I thought, "Surely if they can ask for so much money for this work, then any
competent person would make a killing". Within three months I resigned and
started my own consultancy.

That time was a turning point in Australia. It was the tip of a very high peak. Since that point
growth has been slow. Engineering consultancies have cut staff and the lucky remaining engineers get
paid 9 day fortnights. Council and government consulting jobs are few and far between.

What would they quote now for that same spreadsheet?

### But that isn't the point

When I left those years ago, I was *sure* that the moral of the story was that
clients didn't want a spreadsheet.  It was unprofessional for them to offer us
such a tool written with VBA code. Clients wanted a *real database* with a
beautifully designed front-end. Not so.

They couldn't care less. So long as it works as advertised. 

You see, the point wasn't that we are spending $200k on a spreadsheet. It was
the data inside that was valuable all along. A graduate could whip up a
database + front-end in less than a week. But who would have the knowledge and
experience to fill it with cost estimates for equipment whose costs are so
high that you cannot even ring for a quote?

Anyone can create a polished looking product, to win real contracts, you need to know your trade.
