I don't own a car, and haven't for 4 years. My choice isn't based on an environmental
standpoint, rather it is purely economic. I save money by not owning a car. From time to time
I question whether or not this is true. Especially now with a small child and more frequent
trips to visit grandparents - Is owning a car cheaper?

Today, I present the [*car cost calculator*](#calculator). Use it, and adjust the assumptions to
suit your own situation, perhaps it is cheaper for you too.

Though I don't own a car, I still drive. At times when I need a car, I'll do
a daily hire. There are cars located around my apartment that I can scan with
my wallet to unlock the door and take for a drive. Typically this costs around
$70 for 24 hours, all petrol costs are included.  This system of taking a car
whenever you like, is called "car share". Two of the "car share" companies 
listed here are Flexicar and Goget.

Try the calculator for yourself [below](#calculator). Only read on here for information about
how the numbers work.

Typically, I use the car 4 times a month, and one month of the year I don't use
the car at all (perhaps because of a 3 week holiday overseas). You may also
believe that you don't pay for parking. However, most inner city apartments are
$40 cheaper if they don't come with a parking space. If you don't have a car,
you can rent your parking space out to someone else. We used to get $50 a week
for our parking spot near the city.

The only other variable to watch out for is Flexicar's daily rental fee. The
lowest you'll pay is $55/day, however quite a few of their cars are $65/day.
And you may not be close by to a $55/day car - something for you to consider
when weighing up your options.

"Goget" and "Flexicar" are both competing car sharing services.
