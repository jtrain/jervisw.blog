I take a look at the housing crisis in Los Angeles from 2006 to 2013 to
understand by how much prices fell, and how they have recovered. 

### The regions of Los Angeles

Los Angeles is a large sprawling city, difficult to get around in without
a car, not unlike Melbourne. Los Angeles is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and
mountains. To the east Los Angeles merges into several other cities as far as
a couple of hours drive.

The west and to the south near the water are more up market than the eastern
areas. I'll analyse two areas. West Hollywood which is a hip suburb next to
Beverly Hills, and Eastvale, a relatively newly built commuter city on the
eastern outskirts of Los Angeles.


### The timeline of prices

The housing prices first started to decline around late 2006 and early 2007.
Reproduced here are year end prices for West Hollywood and Eastvale.

Rental figures aren't available, except as a median household figure for
a limited number of years, so the Zillow calculated rental yields are
reproduced here.  The yields look high to me, particularly in Eastvale.
Unfortunately yield figures weren't available from Zillow for the 2006 period
just before the collapse.

&nbsp;
As before, I wasn't able to find data on specific to the number of bedrooms for South
Yarra, so instead I've used "unit" and "house" data and assume that they are
representative of two and 4 bedroom places.
     
### On losing value
West Hollywood fared very well. 4 bedroom prices lost 12% before recovering back to
now pre-collapse pricing. While the smaller 2 bedrooms lost 20% before again recovering close
to the pre-collapse pricing, though not as well as the four bedroom recovery.

In the outer east, prices dropped considerably more. 4 bedroom houses lost 45% and the 2013 year end
prices recovered to a 31% loss, while 2 bedroom homes lost 57% before recovering to 44% lost.

Similarly to the analysis in Dublin, if the yields are to be believed, Eastvale
now looks like an attractive investment opportunity. Of course, an automated
yield calculation doesn't tell the true story about the rental market in
Eastvale. Income from an unrented investment property is zero, so if there is
soft demand for rent in Eastvale those lower prices may be justified.

### Can we apply this to Melbourne?

As with the [Dublin example](/melbourne-house-prices-compared-to-ireland/), I still believe that aspects of the decline may
happen here. The real surprise has been how well West Hollywood houses held
onto their original value.

Reproduced in the above table are the prices for equivalent hypothetical South
Yarra houses and units in 2019. A future price of $1.25 million (compared to $1.4 million today) 
for a home doesn't sound like a bargain.

I'm beginning to believe that any downturn in desireable areas like South Yarra
will be merely a correction in pricing back to fair values, and will not
present much bargin hunting opportunity. Outer areas and commuter cities will
be harder hit, and may see over 50% of the value lost, which may present
opportunities for investment in higher yield properties.
