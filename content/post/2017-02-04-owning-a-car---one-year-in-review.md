title: Owning a car - one year in review.
---

About this time last year, we moved to the suburbs, and bought a beautiful
second-hand Toyota Camry. I've previously written about the
[true costs](/without-owning-a-car/) of owning a car. But while I have owned
one in the past, I didn't at the time of that blog post. I was a happy GoGet
customer, paying for the (few) times I actually needed a car.

A year on. I thought it might be fun to learn how much this car cost us.

Here is the breakdown:

| Description | Cost |
| --- | ---: |
| Depreciation | $2 360 |
| Petrol | $615 |
| Insurance & Rego | $1 342 |
| Maintenance | $693 |
|===
| Total | $5 000 |

Our car depreciated much quicker than the 9% I allowed for in the calculator.
My method for calculating the lost value on the car was to estimate what I
could sell it for today. I'm a lousy salesman, a buyer would negotiate
me to the bottom of the market price. So that's what I picked for the current value.
Next year, I'll also be picking the bottom of the market value, so I expect
the depreciation to settle down to the expected 9% number.

While using Goget and Flexicar we formed a habit of batching up everything
we needed a car for into the one block of time. That habit has stuck even
now that I own a car. For example I take my kids to the pool and also do
my weekly shop at ALDI during the same trip. If we are visiting my parents
we will stop off at some speciality food stores out that way.

It is hard to do an exact comparison between owning a car and using
a car share service. For example, there are no share cars in the suburb we
live in, owning a car is an unfortunate necessity. Rent in the areas that
car share services are available is higher than we pay. On balance,
owning a car has not saved us significant amounts of money, nor
made our lives more enjoyable. I still firmly believe that car share
services are a competitive option for those living closer to the city.
