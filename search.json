I use the same ratios, but in a larger quantity (more mouths to feed now).\nThe sourdough starter hasn’t changed. I’m still using the same one since Jan 2016. It is a workhorse sourdough. I’ve made jam doughnuts, pizza, many types of breads, burger buns, pancakes (who wants pannies for breakfast?) with some regularity.\nALDI changed their flour, it no longer is 10.2 g protein. More like 9.8g from memory. It is still OK for pizza.\nWe changed our oven a few times, our current one is far too cold for pizza. You can tell because it takes upwards of 12 minutes to cook one. That’s too long. My remedy for this (not wasting money on an oven) to come later in the article.\nMy method has changed. I’ll discuss this new method too.\nIngredients This recipe will make 6 large sized pizzas. 1 - 1.5 of these would make a nice dinner for me.\n   Ingredient quantity     Water 650g   Flour 1000g   Starter 50g   Salt 30g    Start the week before Take all the ingredients and bung them into a very large bowl. Its 1kg of flour! Mix them up very well. You might want to add all the water and then 100g of flour at a time if mixing is too hard for you.\nKnead The dough is sticky. You can wet your hands with tap water which will help keep the dough from sticking to you. I knead it for a good 10-15 minutes. Until it is nice and stretchy and doesn’t tear as much when you really pull it out and apart.\nCold rise in the fridge I tear the dough into 6 equal lumps (6 pizzas remember) and put them into separate oiled containers in the fridge. Your dough will rise over a period of minimum 5 days in the fridge! Amazing. Don’t bother if you don’t have at least 5 days. 7 days is good too, I haven’t tried anything longer (hungry person).\nOn the day you want pizza simply take out of the fridge! Wait! I don’t have 5 days to spare sir! Oh sorry. I didn’t see you there Unprepared Person! You need to make pizzas for tonight? Sorry look elsewhere. Pizzas for tomorrow? That’s possible. Just prepare this the night before and perhaps leave in the fridge. Then take out and leave for about 10-12 hrs on the bench, or in the oven with the oven light on (for warmness, not because the dough is scared of the dark).\nMaking the pie Just take your ball of dough and with your hands stretch it out into a pizza shape. Don’t use a rolling pin, since that would knock out the air bubbles. Make the base really really thin, thin enough to see light through it is OK. Make your crust areas nice and plump. They’ll puff up and form the pie around your pizza. Cook with a frying pan and the oven grill I put the oven grill as hot as it will go (remember my oven is terribly cold). I make the pizza base, dress with toppings and cook in a frying pan on the gas top!! This will crisp up the base and get it a delicious golden brown colour in parts. Then put the whole frying pan and pizza straight under the oven grill to cook the top. Should be about 4 -5 minutes under the grill.\nIf I am feeling fancy (and lets face it, I am always feeling fancy) I put some mixed herbs into the oil of the frying pan. This gives the pizza base a sourdough herb bread flavour. Amazing.\n","description":"","tags":["recipe"],"title":"An update about pizza","uri":"/an-update-about-pizza/"},{"content":"Here is the breakdown in costs total for the last four years (estimated):\n   Description Cost     Depreciation $4 000   Petrol $4 000   Insurance \u0026 Rego $5 368   Maintenance $2 772   ===    Total $16 140    It works out to $80/week for the car.\nWe’ve travelled approx 35 000 km, which would be 175km/week.

Dublin real estate data taken from Daft.ie  What is the story today? House prices have continued to recover, and rents too though to a lesser extent. Largely they have not yet recovered to their 2006 values.\nIf you had purchased a 5 bedroom house in 2006 for €1.743M, today with inflation that should be €2.255M. Instead the price is €1.01M, 55% lower.\nIn Australia it seems home prices have increased, though not much more than inflation (%5 growth after inflation), while unit prices have declined. This could be a function of the area, an exceedingly large supply of units has been built in the South Yarra area. Rent prices have declined, both in dollars and when adjusted for inflation.\nPerhaps this is a reflection of the very low wage growth enjoyed by Melbourne professionals over the same period, or again is a function of the increased housing supply in South Yarra and competing suburbs.\n","description":"","tags":["property","pricing"],"title":"House Prices in Dublin, Where are they now?","uri":"/house-prices-in-dublin-where-are-they-now/"},{"content":"   Brewery Beer Style Rating     4 hearts brewing s’more than a feeling sweet stout Excellent   4 pines brewing beast of bourbon wood aged beer Good   Aiba saison a trios saison / farmhouse ale Decent   Barossa valley brewing barrel aged cherry ripe porter porter Decent   Big shed brewing beery ripe porter porter Good   Brisbane brewing pavlova love specialty beer Decent   Bright brewery lamb shank redemption american brown ale Decent   Black heart brewery the dark monk belgian dark strong ale Good   Cavalier French Oaked imperial stout russian imperial stout Great   Brew cult gingerbread maniac spice herb or vegetable beer Good   Kooinda brewery Inkblot stout II: turbo edition Oatmeal stout Excellent   Liberty brewing co alpha obsidian IPA black ipa Good   Mismatch brewing co negroni ipa IPA Good   Modus operandi brewing co black magic woman foreign extra stout Good   Mountain goat brewery captain amylase porter Good   Old wives ales the jackasope IPA Great   Pact beer co pact with the devil Belgian Specialty Ale Great   Robe town brewery moby dick ambergris ale specialty beer Good   Pirate life brewing loose lips sink ships double IPA Excellent   Red hill brewing killer bee Braggot Great   Stone brewing co piquant beere Weiss American Brown Ale Good   Stone and wood jean Claude flan slam sweet stout Good   Two birds brewing jam donut belgian blonde ale Decent   Vale brewing purple haze oatmeal stout Great   wayward brewing funky pineapple hand grenade Brett Beer Good    ","description":"","tags":["general"],"title":"Beer guide 2016","uri":"/beer-guide-2016/"},{"content":"I’ve been asked as part of a school project to write up some of my learnings from running my small business whit.\nWhat were your original motivations going into the business? I outlined my motivations in detail here in [the most expensive spreadsheet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2013-06-01-the-most-expensive-spreadsheet-i-have-seen.md %}). Its a story about how someone quoted $200,000 to build me a spreadsheet.\nHow did the owner identify the business opportunity? At the time, there was a particular type of software that many engineers were using in my field, however none of them were trained to use it adequately. I had 3-4 years experience using the software and saw an opportunity to teach it.\nWhat market research did the owner undertake before commencing the business? Before I’d even written any training material or hired staff, my first step was to attempt to sell the training. I contacted a large engineering firm in New South Wales and managed to sell a $20k training package. Money in the bank is the best and most accurate form of research.\nExplain how the owner used any innovations or specialisations that set them aside from competitors At the time, our competitors were focussed on other areas of training, and ignored the opportunity that I saw. It gave us a period of 1-2 years to develop our reputation and course material. Our course is highly specialised, and only attractive to a small subset of all power systems engineers.\nWhat personal characteristics or skills does the owner believe that they have that enabled them to manage the business You must focus on what is important, and avoid activities that aren’t necessary to earn money. I have some modest ability to sell, more than the average engineer at least, which is important, having the best product won’t automatically qualify you to be a success.\nWhat were the short (first 12 months) and the long (first 5 years) term goals were set for the business when it first began My first goal was to convince someone to pay me at least $1 for something I’d made. It seems strange that I thought like that now, but it was important to me at the time. In 5 years, I’d wanted to have sold our training to all of the large engineering business in Australia something we achieved much earlier than that.\nIdentify any sources of support and advice that the owner has relied upon during the set up and ongoing running of the business When I left my job. A senior manager gave me this advice “Just make sure you have more money coming in than is going out.” I laughed, at the time I had no idea how important this simple sounding advice was. I think about it all the time now. It is important to find other entrepreneuers that you can regularly talk to, it can be a lonely road otherwise.\nDoes the owner believe that the federal or state governments have supported the business, in what ways? Not really. I can point to a few things I am pleased with though.\n Doing business in Australia is easier than in the US (I own a business there too) The small business superannuation clearing house was great for me. It reduced the time I spend on superannuation compliance.  Any suggestions that government should consider to further support the business and entrepreneurship I’m not generally in favour of financial support to small business. From where I stand, having not received any money, it seems like picking winners - though I would change my story if selected for money. I’d much prefer something like a 15% tax rate for business like they have in the US. Or for the government to improve their IT systems so that it isn’t a pain to file things.\n","description":"","tags":["business"],"title":"Questions About Running a Business","uri":"/questions-about-running-a-business/"},{"content":"About this time last year, we moved to the suburbs, and bought a beautiful second-hand Toyota Camry. I’ve previously written about the true costs of owning a car. But while I have owned one in the past, I didn’t at the time of that blog post. I was a happy GoGet customer, paying for the (few) times I actually needed a car.\nA year on. I thought it might be fun to learn how much this car cost us.\nHere is the breakdown:\n   Description Cost     Depreciation $2 360   Petrol $615   Insurance \u0026 Rego $1 342   Maintenance $693   ===    Total $5 000    Our car depreciated much quicker than the 9% I allowed for in the calculator. My method for calculating the lost value on the car was to estimate what I could sell it for today. I’m a lousy salesman, a buyer would negotiate me to the bottom of the market price. So that’s what I picked for the current value. Next year, I’ll also be picking the bottom of the market value, so I expect the depreciation to settle down to the expected 9% number.\nWhile using Goget and Flexicar we formed a habit of batching up everything we needed a car for into the one block of time. That habit has stuck even now that I own a car. For example I take my kids to the pool and also do my weekly shop at ALDI during the same trip. If we are visiting my parents we will stop off at some speciality food stores out that way.\nIt is hard to do an exact comparison between owning a car and using a car share service. For example, there are no share cars in the suburb we live in, owning a car is an unfortunate necessity. Rent in the areas that car share services are available is higher than we pay. On balance, owning a car has not saved us significant amounts of money, nor made our lives more enjoyable. I still firmly believe that car share services are a competitive option for those living closer to the city.\nYou don’t need to own a car (but I do).\n","description":"","tags":["pricing"],"title":"Owning a car - one year in review.","uri":"/owning-a-car-one-year-in-review./"},{"content":"When I worked for a big company, I dreamed of working for myself so I could set my own hours and work schedule. My salary increases would be linked to how hard I worked, not how well I was able to game the HR department.\nIf I could set my hours and work schedule, perhaps I could work from anywhere in the world. A park bench, library, the beach, even another country. At least this is what I thought would happen to me. However once I stopped consulting work, and was truly location independent, I was reluctant to move anywhere. Why is it that when given the freedom to move my choice was - do nothing?\nThinking about it. When friends have moved to another city or country, it wasn’t their idea. Instead their work gave them the opportunity and paid relocation expenses. But in the scheme of things relocation costs aren’t that high, certainly not prohibitive enough to deter someone determined for an adventure. It seems strange that a person would happily up and move somewhere a business had chosen in return for some relocation costs, but not move to a location of their own choosing if given the opportunity.\nSo we decided to move to Sri Lanka. Melbourne is a very expensive city to live in and it seemed crazy to continue to pay so much when I didn’t have to. One of my goals in moving was to save money relative to what I would have paid living in Melbourne. Now that a year has passed since we came back, here is a breakdown of what we paid living in Sri Lanka - and travelling to Germany, and what we pay living in Melbourne.\n   Description Sri Lanka Melbourne     rent 2200 7800   credit 4700 6100   cash 5400 4100   flights 3700    ===     total 16000 18000    I am surprised. While I was travelling, and handing over physical cash, it felt like money was draining away so fast. The reality was quite the opposite. Despite the expense of travelling through Germany, flights, paying for storage here in Australia, overall we saved some money compared to business as usual here in Melbourne.\nWe won’t be doing this again any time soon I don’t think. The experience was great but now with two kids it seems more appropriate to live near our extended family than some random location in the world.\n","description":"","tags":["pricing"],"title":"Work from anywhere","uri":"/work-from-anywhere/"},{"content":"(2020 update here)\nI found a website here with the best pizza base recipe I’ve read and I refer to it every few weeks when I make my own pizza bases.\nVarasanos recipe has a lot of theory about what makes a good base. It is a lot to wade through, so I have taken the key parts I use and reproduced them here, while adding my own specific method.\nI use cheap flour. ALDI 79c flour with 10.2g protein per 100g is fine. The sourdough I have been feeding since Jan 2016. Instructions for getting your own will not be included here. I use normal Melbourne tap water.\nIngredients This recipe will make 3 medium sized pizzas. 1.5 of these would make a nice dinner for me.\n   Ingredient quantity     Water 330g   Flour 510g   Starter 1/4 cup   Salt 20g    Start the day before Take 250g of the flour, and all of the water. Mix in a bowl until like pancake batter then stir through the starter. Leave this for let’s say 8-12 hrs on a bench or cupboard out of sunlight.\nCombine to make dough Then add the remaining flour, salt and mix until mostly combined. Let it sit there for 20-40 minutes. This is called the autolyse stage, and makes the kneading easier.\nKnead The ALDI flour with this water combination will be extremely sticky. You can use a mixer if you like, but I’ve gotten used to kneading with my hands. I knead it for a good 10-15 minutes. Until it is nice and stretchy and doesn’t tear as much when you really pull it out and apart.\nLet it rest At this point, you can put into some lightly oiled containers and pop into the fridge until the day you are ready to cook. I’ve kept dough in the fridge for a whole week and it was delicious.\nOn the day you want pizza give the dough 2-3 hours of bench time to rise and shake off the fridge coldness. Making the pie Just take your ball of dough and with your hands stretch it out into a pizza shape. Don’t use a rolling pin, since that would knock out the air bubbles. Make the base really really thin, thin enough to see light through it is OK. Make your crust areas nice and plump. They’ll puff up and form the pie around your pizza. Oven as hot as it will go. I warm my oven up for 1 hr on its highest setting - 250C with a pizza stone inside the entire time. Then I do 5-10 minutes baking the bare base, top it with toppings and bake for another while longer, until you can see everything is cooked, 10-15 minutes perhaps.\n","description":"","tags":["recipe"],"title":"Pizza Base Recipe with Sourdough Starter","uri":"/pizza-base-recipe-with-sourdough-starter/"},{"content":"A friend and I were talking about finding a house to buy. The prices in Melbourne are high. They are unaffordably high. Worse than buying property in Switzerland. Men and women live with their parents until their late twenties and thirties to save for a deposit. And whilst they save, property increases by more than 10 percent per year, outpacing their meager interest and dividend yields. Those who bid at an auction helplessly watch the sale price sail $200,000 beyond the advertised rate.\nAnd still you want to buy a house. One that meets your criteria and budget. I can’t help you find a house that meets your budget. I can help you find a house that meets some of your criteria. “I want a house walking distance from a train station, with parks and a library nearby”. Without having lived in the suburb, how would you find if such an area existed? The normal process for finding a house is: You’d look on the real estate website for an acceptable price and nice looking photo, then read the map to see if it were close to trains, a park or a library.\nWell, welcome to the future. Inspired by the idea behind “walk score” I decided to take a map, and highlight the areas around things that interest me. If there were lots of things that interested me nearby, it would be shaded darker. So now you can visually scan suburbs at a time, looking for ‘hot spots’ that match your criteria.\nAmusingly, the data quality provided isn’t A+. Sometimes what is listed as a ‘park’ is actually someone’s business who decided they were also a park, since they are experts at landscaping. I have paid nothing for it, so I have no complaints.

I found that Sydney - $125.9/litre - on average was actually more expensive than Melbourne - $123.4/litre. The ‘fuel cycles’ in Sydney and Melbourne are not entirely in sync. The price differences were simply a factor of Sydney being at the lower portion of its cycle while Melbourne was in the higher portion.\nAccording to the RAA - South Australian Royal Automobile Association, the fuel cycle are driven by competition. When margins are at their highest, little by little retailers compete with each other by slowly lowering the price. As to what causes such a large rapid rise in the first place?

Los Angeles is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and mountains. To the east Los Angeles merges into several other cities as far as a couple of hours drive.\nThe west and to the south near the water are more up market than the eastern areas. I’ll analyse two areas. West Hollywood which is a hip suburb next to Beverly Hills, and Eastvale, a relatively newly built commuter city on the eastern outskirts of Los Angeles.\nThe timeline of prices The housing prices first started to decline around late 2006 and early 2007. Reproduced here are year end prices for West Hollywood and Eastvale.\nRental figures aren’t available, except as a median household figure for a limited number of years, so the Zillow calculated rental yields are reproduced here. The yields look high to me, particularly in Eastvale. Unfortunately yield figures weren’t available from Zillow for the 2006 period just before the collapse.\n RegionYearBedsYieldPurchase (USD or AUD) '000s   West Hollywood200641998 West Hollywood201045.20%1757 West Hollywood201344.65%2166 West Hollywood20062777 West Hollywood20102624 West Hollywood20132746 Eastvale20064568 Eastvale201047.9%314 Eastvale201346.3%391 Eastvale20062385 Eastvale20102164 Eastvale20132215 South Yarra2014house2.80%1419 South Yarra2019house5.00%851.4 South Yarra2014unit4.01%611 South Yarra2019unit6.00%366.6  House Prices and Rents. Los Angeles real estate data taken from Zillow Research   As before, I wasn’t able to find data on specific to the number of bedrooms for South Yarra, so instead I’ve used “unit” and “house” data and assume that they are representative of two and 4 bedroom places.\nOn losing value West Hollywood fared very well. 4 bedroom prices lost 12% before recovering back to now pre-collapse pricing. While the smaller 2 bedrooms lost 20% before again recovering close to the pre-collapse pricing, though not as well as the four bedroom recovery.\nIn the outer east, prices dropped considerably more. 4 bedroom houses lost 45% and the 2013 year end prices recovered to a 31% loss, while 2 bedroom homes lost 57% before recovering to 44% lost.\nSimilarly to the analysis in Dublin, if the yields are to be believed, Eastvale now looks like an attractive investment opportunity. Of course, an automated yield calculation doesn’t tell the true story about the rental market in Eastvale. Income from an unrented investment property is zero, so if there is soft demand for rent in Eastvale those lower prices may be justified.\nCan we apply this to Melbourne? As with the Dublin example, I still believe that aspects of the decline may happen here. The real surprise has been how well West Hollywood houses held onto their original value.\nReproduced in the above table are the prices for equivalent hypothetical South Yarra houses and units in 2019. A future price of $1.25 million (compared to $1.4 million today) for a home doesn’t sound like a bargain.\nI’m beginning to believe that any downturn in desireable areas like South Yarra will be merely a correction in pricing back to fair values, and will not present much bargin hunting opportunity. Outer areas and commuter cities will be harder hit, and may see over 50% of the value lost, which may present opportunities for investment in higher yield properties.\n","description":"","tags":["property","pricing"],"title":"The Los Angeles Housing Market Compared to Melbourne","uri":"/the-los-angeles-housing-market-compared-to-melbourne/"},{"content":"click here to see the calculator\nI don’t own a car, and haven’t for 4 years. My choice isn’t based on an environmental standpoint, rather it is purely economic. I save money by not owning a car. From time to time I question whether or not this is true. Especially now with a small child and more frequent trips to visit grandparents - Is owning a car cheaper?\nToday, I present the car cost calculator. Use it, and adjust the assumptions to suit your own situation, perhaps it is cheaper for you too.\nThough I don’t own a car, I still drive. At times when I need a car, I’ll do a daily hire. There are cars located around my apartment that I can scan with my wallet to unlock the door and take for a drive. Typically this costs around $70 for 24 hours, all petrol costs are included. This system of taking a car whenever you like, is called “car share”. Two of the “car share” companies listed here are Flexicar and Goget.\nTry the calculator for yourself below. Only read on here for information about how the numbers work.\nTypically, I use the car 4 times a month, and one month of the year I don’t use the car at all (perhaps because of a 3 week holiday overseas). You may also believe that you don’t pay for parking. However, most inner city apartments are $40 cheaper if they don’t come with a parking space. If you don’t have a car, you can rent your parking space out to someone else. We used to get $50 a week for our parking spot near the city.\nThe only other variable to watch out for is Flexicar’s daily rental fee. The lowest you’ll pay is $55/day, however quite a few of their cars are $65/day. And you may not be close by to a $55/day car - something for you to consider when weighing up your options.\n{% include plugins/purecss-form.min.css %} {% include plugins/purecss-menu.min.css %} {% include purecss.html %} {% include plugins/carcost.html %}\n“Goget” and “Flexicar” are both competing car sharing services.\nback to article\n","description":"","tags":["pricing"],"title":"Without owning a car","uri":"/without-owning-a-car/"},{"content":"{% include purecss.html %}\nAsk two people what they think about Melbourne’s property prices and you’ll likely get two different answers. Since I don’t own a house, I have an interest in seeing house prices in Melbourne come down from their current levels. Specifically I’d like to see prices reduced in the areas that I’d like to live in, since isolated reductions elsewhere are irrelevant to me. On the other hand many of my friends own houses. They would prefer to continue seeing their investment rise in value.\nIf we were to have a decline in house prices, like the well publicised decline in Ireland that accompanied the financial crisis, how much lower would they fall? And how long would it take house prices to reach the bottom? Finally I wondered if buying in a good region protected against significant losses.\nI found a record of the historical prices and rents for two regions around Dublin, before, during and after the financial crisis at different sized properties. Armed with those numbers, I calculated the decline in prices, and changes in rental yield.\nThe regions of Dublin Dublin, the main city in Ireland is divided by a river through it’s center. The coastal, eastern suburbs to the north and south are more upmarket than the inner and west suburbs. Specifically the southern suburbs are where I focussed my attention. Those suburbs represent the tradition of buying an expensive house in a good location with the best schools. While the western and inner areas tended to be more for the working class.\nYou could draw parallels between those southern coastal suburbs to our own southeast suburbs along the river like South Yarra and Toorak. And along the coast towards Brighton.\nThe timeline of prices The housing prices first started to decline around 2007. Reproduced here are prices and rents for southern coastal houses (South Co) and those in the west. Finally also calculated is the rental yield at each point.\n RegionYearBedsYieldRentPurchase ($ or euro)/mo($ or euro) '000s   South Co200653.20%46521743 South Co201053.30%2484903 South Co201354.95%3282796 South Co200624.10%1436420 South Co201024.55%1163307 South Co201326.25%1349259 West200652.88%1334555 West201053.89%1623501 West201354.19%1300372 West200624.13%1114324 West201025.92%883179 West201329.20%928121 South Yarra2014house2.80%33061419 South Yarra2019house5.00%3547.5851.4 South Yarra2014unit4.01%2041611 South Yarra2019unit6.00%1833366.6  House Prices and Rents. Dublin real estate data taken from Daft.ie   I wasn’t able to find data on specific to the number of bedrooms for South Yarra, so instead I’ve used “unit” and “house” data and assume that they are representative of two and 5 bedroom places.\nOn losing half the value In the affluent South Coast, the larger five bedroom houses lost more value relative to the smaller two bedroom units. While in the west it was reversed, and the five bedroom houses retained more than the two bedrooms.\nFor the two bedroom units, rental yields were 4.1% in 2006 and increased to now 6.25% in 2013. With the yields so high, the market is showing signs of growth. It is interesting to note that two bedroom rental yields are now a staggering 9% in the west. I understand that the west had an oversupply of housing and that many construction sites were left empty as projects were abandoned. My guess is that many units in the west remain vacant and so earn no rent at all, and this isn’t reflected in the 9% rental yield figure. Either that, or the west has been oversold and now is a perfect time to make an investment.\nCan we apply this to Melbourne? I don’t know. Since the results confirm my biases I hope we can, however I suspect the answer is “It’s more complicated than that”.\nRegardless, I’m going to take a look at the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra as a point of comparison.\nWeekly two bedroom rents in the past year have increased by $20 in the last year, or 4% while purchase prices have increased 12%. Rental yields are currently at 4.0% - lower than the yields before the crisis in Dublin.\nA 2 bedroom unit in South Yarra can fetch $611k right now, if over the next 5 years prices were to decline in line with that in Dublin, then in 2019 that same 2 bedroom unit would be $366k. A twenty percent deposit would cost $72k compared to $112k now.\nOf course, the decline in Ireland was accompanied with a terrible recession. Many adults were unemployed. Unemployed people are unlikely to afford a deposit to purchase housing - no doubt a significant contributor to the decline.\nTo those waiting for their chance First home buyers waiting for their chance to purchase may find that they are without a job and so still cannot afford the reduced house prices - if they ever eventuate.\n","description":"","tags":["property","pricing"],"title":"Melbourne House Prices Compared to Ireland","uri":"/melbourne-house-prices-compared-to-ireland/"},{"content":"It’s quiet.

Talking like a hipster about riding your bike and working from park benches is useless if no one gets any work done. But I’m here to tell you that I get plenty of work done. It is easy to set up the remote working lifestyle. And I’ll share exactly how I set it up. The more advanced configuration will be spared for another technical post. Most of what I talk about here can be used by any of my desk-bound brethren - not just programmers.\nWhat is a typical day like? This is how a day goes down. First a quick check to see if anything needs my urgent attention on email. If not I’ll pull up my list of TODO items and work out which I can realistically finish today.\nAfter the first item or part of a TODO item is finished in my morning work period, I’ll take a break at 10:30 then take my laptop and bike for a 15 minute ride to find a picnic bench to set up. I can work for about 1-2 hours on the battery life I have then I ride back home and work the rest of the day indoors.\nWorking from multiple computers I spend most of my time on a big desktop computer, but when I ride it has to stay home.

You could work online using Google Docs, or just use the same laptop to do all of your work.\nThings you will need Here are my thoughts on what works and what doesn’t for working out of the office:\n You need the internet  It’s a reflex to reach for Google whenever you come up with a question. Don’t kid yourself, make sure you have a phone that is capable of sharing it’s internet connection as a wireless hotspot, or work from a cafe or library somewhere with internet.\n Don’t go too far  Don’t ride much further than 6-8 km to your destination. You are doing this for the fresh air and change of scenery, not the exercise. Travelling a shorter distance gives you the confidence that you can quickly return home if something needs your urgent attention.\n Have something concrete to achieve  The change in scene will give you some fresh focus, use it to actually finish a task that could be completed in about 1-2 hours. Once you’ve done the task, call it a day and go home. I reckon if you try and stick it out too long, you wont be as productive as that initial hour. Also you’ll run out of bread having fed all the ducks.\n Pick a picnic bench not a grassy slope  I reckon that sitting at a proper bench and table is best for maintaining your focus. I’ve tried sitting on the grass and other random ledges, but I wasn’t really at my best.\n A bit of shush please  Don’t bother with spots near a busy road, you won’t get used to the noise. It’ll just grate you. Stress isn’t good for focus.\nSome random places I went to Here are some random places I went to before winter.

I’ve fallen into the trap of not wanting to sound too salesy, but seeing it now from the other end, I didn’t mind. I wasn’t tempted to click the “spam” button . The sales rep was clearly talking directly to us with a product that was relevant.\nSo why no sale? After some back and forwards with their sales rep, we found their product didn’t do what we wanted.

And was ripped off. It made me angry and I opened up my editor to write this blog post as a warning for others.\nA government mandated scam I consider myself fairly computer savvy, and read most of the fine print - most of the time, yet here I was the victim of a scam. Not just any old scam, a government mandated scam. You see, we don’t get a choice whether or not we have superannuation, everyone earning income must have these benefits paid by their employer. Even if you are your own employer and don’t want to. While researching for this post, what I found wasn’t as bad as I first thought. In fact, it was pretty good. So I’ve changed my mind about superannuation, here is the story.\nLast minute signup Last financial year, I found that I must make payments to my own super account, because I employ myself even though those payments are “directors fees”. I discovered this 2 days before the end of financial year just before I was getting ready to make my director fee payments. Simple. I’ll just make a payment to my existing superannuation account. Not so. In order to make the payment it was going to take a week’s worth of paperwork. Why can’t I just sign up online as an employer? Anyway, I signed up with another fund, because I’m already listed as an employer there. I made the payments and thought that would be it.\nThen I get a letter in the mail I get a welcome pack in the mail a few days later. It congratulates me on signing up and informs that my life insurance, income protection insurance and total permanent disability insurance is all set up and the fee is being debited per week. Wait. I didn’t ever consent to paying for life insurance! And I certainly don’t want to buy it from my super provider for $9/week. Imagine that, every week for the rest of my working life paying $9 for something I didn’t want!\nAny insurance should be off by default This is what made me the most upset. Luckily opting out was easy enough through their website. But I thought it should have been opt-in to begin with. $9/week was the price for all three insurances. This particular super fund has almost 2 million members. The fat cats in the super fund office must be rocking back and forwards in their ergonomic chairs laughing while pressing F5 on their keyboard to refresh their ever high climbing bank account totals.\nBut sadly this part isn’t true. I wasn’t able to find a single insurance package for a lower price that had the same level of cover. It seems like they do cost around $9/week for those three insurances. Ok, so they aren’t ripping me off on the insurance prices. Sure they’d get a kickback from whoever they deal their insurance with, but they aren’t gouging on price which is nice.\nBy now I was looking for an excuse Then I considered that superannuation itself is a rip off. They charge admin fees, investing fees and performance fees even though they rarely perform well and could never hope to beat the stock market, or even keep up with it. What I found next was suprising.\nConsider a hypothetical investment of $50,000 left to sit in your super fund under the “bonds” option compared with the same amount invested in an actual industry based bonds fund.\n For the super fund, 0.31% fees + 0.11% admin fees (yearly) For the industry based bonds fund 0.7% (yearly)  The industry based fund is 0.28% more expensive than the similar fund inside the super scheme. Well that was a pleasant finding. Perhaps I’ll leave my money in super after all.\n","description":"","tags":["business"],"title":"Superannuation an excuse to rip us off, or so I thought","uri":"/superannuation-an-excuse-to-rip-us-off-or-so-i-thought/"},{"content":"I use Firefox.

We needed a way to forecast the cost of projects whose assets alone run into the tens of millions of dollars. Three engineering consultancies submitted bids, one bid in particular changed the way I see business forever.\nJust a Spreadsheet This particular company met with me in person. A senior partner and an engineering manager came to our head office in Melbourne to talk about the tender. They had already done this exact same job for another company in New Zealand. Their forecasting tool was written a few years ago and was still used today. Getting our job done was going to be low risk, because they already had the expertise. They had also worked on so many engineering projects that they had access to very detailed historical cost information that could populate our forecasting tool.\nI was excited. Here was this large engineering firm that had taken the time to visit, and had already done the job before. None of the other invited companies saw us in person.\nThen I read their proposal.\nTheir description, which spread over many pages, boiled down to a spreadsheet that would be populated by a junior engineer, and checked off by the senior engineer. They would not provide detailed costs to populate the forecast and instead use some more generic ones they had access to.\nI was a little disappointed.\nLooking back, I am not sure what it was that I was expecting.

So long as it works as advertised.\nYou see, the point wasn’t that we are spending $200k on a spreadsheet. It was the data inside that was valuable all along.

I’m not sold on the Software as a Service (SaaS) method of pricing  I’m not talking about the first meaning here. Certainly it’s clear, people don’t like to pay for things that don’t deliver value to them.\nNo. What I’m talking about is when potential customers question the SaaS pricing model, which typically involves a recurring payment per month, and in my case per year.\nOur recurring payment pricing was rejected We primarily consult to power systems engineering businesses. In the opening story we were contracted to develop a new tool to help engineers in a government type organisation. I thought that the idea behind the software tool had sales potential. I guessed that we could licence it more broadly than just that company, so I proposed two pricing options:\n They retain IP ownership but we bill at the usual contracting rate We get IP ownership, but we don’t bill for our time at all. Instead they become our first customer to use the new tool for a lower yearly fee (including maintenance).  I could see their lead engineer look puzzled and into the distance when he heard that second option. There was a calculation being made where our yearly license fee was being multiplied by some number of years. Forever. They didn’t accept the idea of the yearly fee and instead chose the ( much higher) contracting rate.\nWorries about paying for your product When customers question your recurring pricing model, they are worrying. They worry What happens if I stop paying?. The traditional retail model has always been purchase something and you own it forever. And this mindset also creeps over into purchasing B2B software. So your customer worries, if I stop paying, will I lose all my work? How could I transfer my work to another provider? What if you go out of business?\nThey also do a multiplication in their head to arrive at the true cost of your product. $20 per month times X months equals $Y dollars. Unfortunately for you, the person asking this question uses a very high number of months, or even worse, multiplies by forever. Suddenly your $20 per month product looks very expensive once it has been multiplied by 10, 50 or 100 years.\nChange your pitch! When a customer questions the way you charge, there may be an impedance mismatch between your pricing and the product for that customer.\nYour product is being compared against competitors, and for you some of those might be fixed cost, like traditional boxed software. And if being a hosted SaaS doesn’t bring any obvious benefits to the consumer, then they quite rightly may question why they are paying every month.\nWould your product make more sense packaged as purchase to own with yearly upgrade cycle? The Adobe Creative suite followed this model for many years. Their pitch was always that you owned the product for life. In reality they prompted people to upgrade every two years to take advantage of the cheaper upgrade path. And now they only offer monthly pricing with their Creative Cloud suite. $50 per month versus the $2000 outright purchase for the entire suite earlier.\nAdobe is breaking the waves for the rest of us. We can watch and see how things play out for them. Will consumers, previously accustomed to a once off payment take to the monthly subscription? Or will Adobe’s sales buckle and they once again begin shipping boxed software?\nWhat to do next time Next time you are asked Why should I pay for your SaaS every month. Consider what they are thinking, how they’ve multiplied your monthly cost to arrive at the total cost. And what they are comparing your offering against.\nYou may just find the pitch that works for both you and your customers.\n","description":"","tags":["marketing"],"title":"Why Should I Pay for Your SaaS Every Month?","uri":"/why-should-i-pay-for-your-saas-every-month/"},{"content":"I’ve been making yoghurt at home My secret hobby. Making yoghurt at home, inspired by the thick buffalo curd they make in Sri Lanka.\nAnd you know what? It isn’t hard to make. You could eat thick yoghurt every day of the week. Here is how\nAre you qualified to tell me about yoghurt? The current batch of yoghurt represents my 18th so far. I’ll be honest, the first 12 were not fantastic, there were some that I couldn’t eat. They were so foul that I thought about giving up on making yoghurt all together.\nMy wife and I have a ritual, where I dish the yoghurt after the meal and we sit and enjoy it together. During those dark times, I lost all energy to serve yoghurt and she ate the store bought variety.\nThere was light at the end of the tunnel. The last 6 batches have been amazing without fail. And the reason they were so consistently good is because of a handful of simple steps that I’ve learned.\nThese later batches are thicker and tangier than anything I have bought in a shop. They are the perfect yoghurt.\nHere is how you make the perfect yoghurt Heat the milk Heat 3 and a half cups ~ 0.875 quarts of milk and a quarter cup of cream in a small saucepan to 85 degrees celcius ~ 185 F. Once the temp hits around 60 celcius ~ 140 F, start gently stirring the milk with a spoon. You don’t want to burn the bottom of the milk.\nwhy heat the milk? Firstly, it’s a good step to kill any bacteria that are growing in it (highly unlikely if bought from a shop) but the most important point is that it denatures the proteins in the milk. It breaks them down so that our live yoghurt cultures can snack on them and make better yoghurt.\nhow long does it take? I’ve found that on a low-medium heat the milk will rise by 10 celcius in 5 minutes. At 60 celcius you’ve got 12 or so minutes to go.\nLet the milk cool slowly to 45 degrees celcius Once the milk reaches 85 celcius, turn off the heat. Let it sit in the saucepan and cool naturally by the air. Give your milk a stir every 10-15 minutes to let off some steam. You’ll see a thick layer form at the top of your milk. This is normal, it’s the fat in the cream. Just stir it gently back in.\nhow long does it take? It will take about 1-2 hours to cool down to 45 degrees celcius ~ 113 F. So feel free to watch the evening’s TV and stir the milk during the ad breaks.\nGently stir in the old yoghurt Your old yoghurt should be at room temperature. Stir 3 soup spoons into your milk. This is important, do not stir vigorously you’ll curdle the milk! It’s completely OK if your old yoghurt settles in lumps at the bottom. Relax and be gentle.\nPour milk into a container and keep warm Yoghurt cultures love to breed in warm temperatures - not hot, warm.\n 50 celcius ~ 122 F will kill your yoghurt; 43 celcius ~ 109 F is on the upper end and will promote rapid growth and course grained yoghurt; and 38 celcius ~ 100 F close to body temp will produce a slower growth but a much smoother and creamier yoghurt.  I suggest sticking as close to 38 celcius ~ 100 F as you can. The yoghurt that results is smooth and creamy, it’s the result of a slow yoghurt growing process.\nKeep warm for 12 hours I like my yoghurt thick and tangy. Yoghurt thickens by about 6 hours, after that each additional hour will give you more tang. So if you like your yoghurt bland, stop after 6 or so hours, but the rest of us keep waiting until you hit the magical 12 (overnight is good).\nRefrigerate for 6 hours Stick your yoghurt in the fridge once you’ve finished growing it. The cool temperature in the fridge stops the yoghurt growth and allows it to set even firmer.\nAt this point, your yoghurt is read to eat. But I have one more step to make the perfect thick yoghurt.\nStrain your yoghurt for 2 hours I have a cotton singlet which I purchased in a 4 pack from the supermarket stretched over a colander. Then I tip all of the yoghurt into the colander, with a bowl underneath to collect the whey. You can keep it out on a bench or in the fridge, it’s up to you.\nAfter 1 to 2 hours you’ll see a pool of greenish watery liquid in the bowl under your colander. Your singlet will be completely soaking wet. That liquid is whey. It’s naturally separated out of the yoghurt curd, leaving behind a really thick set yoghurt.\nThis step is an absolute must if you want really thick yoghurt. Your strained whey is useful too. You can use it in bread (I’ve never done that), drink it in a protein drink (I’ve never done that either). Or put it on your tomato plants (I have done that). The tomatoes love the calcium.\nThe secrets that make yoghurt amazing Recipes are great to have, I followed some I found while I was developing this yoghurt recipe. But if you want your yoghurt perfect every time with a great consistency and flavour then you’ll need these secrets. They are the difference between those first 12 inconsistent attempts and the last 6 amazing ones.\nThermometer Buy a food thermometer. There isn’t much point making yoghurt unless you have one. I got mine at about batch 12 and found that I was killing my yoghurt by incubating at 50 celcius. You’ll be bitten by similar problems unless you get a thermometer.\nRice Cooker My secret to keeping the yoghurt warm is a rice cooker which I leave on “keep warm” mode. With it’s lid off it keeps my yoghurt at the perfect 38 celcius. I fill the rice cooker with enough water to cover the yoghurt container when it is sitting inside. Cream Buffalo milk like they use in Sri Lanka doesn’t need to be strained. It’s thick already. It has a much higher fat content than cows milk, which is why the yoghurt gets so thick. I use the cream to boost the fat content a little. Don’t add much. Stick to the guidelines I listed above. Otherwise your yoghurt will taste like the sour cream you buy in the shop.\nStarter Yogurt I use my last batch to start the next one, but I’ve tried several store bought varieties. I found that starting with a runnier yoghurt like one formed by goats milk lead to similar yoghurt growing. So now I start with a thick unflavoured natural greek yoghurt.\nWhat makes your yoghurt amazing? Is your yoghurt a total success or a flop?

That’s the promise given by the new breed of business incubators. Also known as startup incubators or seed accelerators. They give you access to business mentors, networking events and up to $25k funding in return for a portion of your business. I spoke with Rebecca from NinjaThat about how the accelerator experience changed her and her company\nWhat is it like to apply? Competition is fierce for the established three: Ycombinator, TechStars and DreamIt Ventures. TechStars accepts 1% of their applications, and DreamIt ventures accepted 15 of 500 applications.\nAfter some encouragement by David Cohen, the founder of TechStars, Rebecca and her team made an application to four accelerators.\nThey discovered that accelerators weren’t looking for people who were building the next big thing.\n Almost every accelerator we talked to, applied to, or even looked at makes a large percentage of their acceptance decisions based on team first\n The team is more important than the idea. And to identify which teams, the first filter is video. Sometimes up to two video submissions are required before being accepted for an in-person interview.\nRebecca spoke about how it felt to be accepted after 6 months of applications:\n It was sort of like Christmas morning. We had spent about six months applying, interviewing, waiting, and being rejected at that point. It feels good when a group of people much smarter and more experienced than you validate your idea.\n More work compressed into a short space of time Each team is working on growing their own business over a three month period until the final demo day. At demo day investors, mentors and peers watch silently as you pitch your business.\n You’re expected to hit awesome milestones and you never want to let your mentors down during your weekly meeting, so you haul ass for three months and try to do everything you can. Literally, I was trying to accomplish three days of work in one day (including school work), everyday!\n Your team is surrounded by others who are working even harder to make themselves a success and meet their milestones. Paul Graham, the founder of Ycombinator (YC) talks about the revenue growth that he expects to see from a startup\n A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week. If you can hit 10% a week you’re doing exceptionally well. If you can only manage 1%, it’s a sign you haven’t yet figured out what you’re doing.\n That 5% weekly increase translates to a 12x growth over a year. Rebecca did feel the pressure. But it affected her in a way you wouldn’t expect:\n Somehow, and I honestly don’t know how, but I finished the semester with the best semester GPA I’ve had since I was a Freshman.\n Rebecca commuted to the Philadelphia based TechStars as often as she could and worked remotely the remainder of the time. This is an unusual circumstance - most teams work in Philadelphia full time.\nAfter the accelerator Startup life doesn’t quite return to normal. After the accelerator period, companies typically begin their first fund-raising round.\n This can be a pretty slow process, but at the same time you have to work 2x as hard to show traction\n Without the weekly mentor meetings and with all the ups and downs that fund-raising can bring it can be easy to lose focus. It is important for startups to connect with a strong alumni network, which was one intent behind YC’s HackerNews.\nStartup Accelerators can bring unexpected perks One of Rebecca’s favourite customers was her own accelerator DreamIt Ventures.\n Dana, the program manager, was having difficulty finding a photographer and videographer to capture Demo Day that didn’t bust her budget. She had been quoted everywhere from $1200 - $2000 for a day’s worth of work. I told her that was ridiculous and I could get her an insanely talented Ninja team to handle it for under $1000. Within an hour, we had three Ninjas in the Philadelphia area that were able to handle the all day event plus post-production editing for $800, total.\n Rebecca said that one key to her success was finding balance.\n Personally, I grew a lot. Prior to being a co-founder, I had to learn how to balance my personal and school life. Once I became a co-founder, I had to relearn that balance pertaining to work and school balance\n Enough balance to meet the weekly milestones, complete coursework and remain social. When time lines are so compressed in the accelerator, the stuff we do that doesn’t really have an impact falls away.\nIf you need to hire a student, say Hi to Rebecca at NinjaThat.\n","description":"","tags":["interview","startup"],"title":"Life in an accelerated startup","uri":"/life-in-an-accelerated-startup/"},{"content":"Business growth secret number one. It’s who you know. When more potential customers know about you. Then you can close more sales. If only a handful of people have heard of you. Your sales will also be only a handful.\nLaura Saillard from Virtual Drafting Assistant used LinkedIn to grow her potential customer base. She went from 20 to 500+ connections. She spoke with me about how she did it\nWhere You Start Doesn’t Matter Laura says you don’t need a lot of connections to get started. While the average LinkedIn user has 50 - 60 connections, Laura had only 20 connections. They were her old colleagues and friends. By following this simple procedure - Laura now has 500+ connections and 10 - 12 new connections are added every day.\nClean Up Your Profile Her first step was to clean up her profile. She removed anything that looked negative in a professional sense and added much more information. Her job experience and background section now read more like a real business sales pitch than a plain old resume.\nConnect With Your Boss’ Mates Laura checked out her old boss’ connections and saw that many of them were leaders in the industry. Plucking up the courage, she sent her first connection request. The people she connected with? Owners, Directors and Associates - people with an ability to make decisions about outsourcing in their company.\nHere is a tip from Laura. Try to personalise your request if you can. You’ll have a better chance of being accepted if you put some of your own personality into the request message.\nSlowly Your Connections Will Grow Once you’ve added a few connections, you will be able to use the Suggested Connections section to begin connecting with your 2nd degree connections. Pace yourself. Don’t add more than about 10 connections per day. Laura says there was a time where she was restricted because too many people said they didn’t know her. If this happens to you there is light at the end of the tunnel. Laura says that after a period of time your restrictions will be lifted.\nWhen your connections grow - so does traffic to your profile. Laura says to check who viewed your profile and send a connection request to them too. As your number of connections grows there is a snowball effect, and adding new connections becomes easier.\nEmail Your New Connections Every new connection gets a personalised email from Laura. In it she thanks them for becoming a connection, explains the reasoning behind Virtual Drafting Assistant and how she can help. If you want to see exactly how the welcome email is worded, you can add Laura to your connections here au.linkedin.com/in/virtualdraftingassistant\nThis is What Success Looks Like Laura has found paid clients through her new LinkedIn connections - and those clients are so pleased with her work they refer her to other new clients in the “real world”. All of these potential customers without paying a cent for LinkedIn.\nHave you found success on LinkedIn? Tell your story in the comments - and say Hi to Laura at Virtual Drafting Assistant the service for architects, interior designers, developers and builders who want drafting done without hiring additional staff.\n","description":"","tags":["interview","marketing","startup"],"title":"From 20 to 500+ on LinkedIn","uri":"/from-20-to-500-on-linkedin/"},{"content":"Offer a guarantee. One so generous that it keeps you awake at night. You can’t sleep - you’re being way too generous, and people will take advantage of your good nature. Now make the guarantee even better. Crazy? Here is a man who did just that.\nThe Master Parts Guarantee James runs the online store Master Parts which sells Porsche and MINI car parts. He spoke with me about how Master Parts’ guarantee boosts customer confidence, decreases buyer’s remorse and increases sales.\nHere is the Master Parts guarantee:\n But we want you to be completely confident that there is no risk in buying from us, so we’re going to make it really simple: If you’ve bought something from us and you’re not completely happy with it for any reason, return it for a full refund, including the cost of returning it. All we ask is that you contact us first so that we can agree on a shipping method back to us.\n Let’s unpack this guarantee together and learn how to apply it to your business.\nCustomers stuck with parts they don’t want Customers are not 100% sure that a product is perfect for them until they have held it in their hands. They are fearful that the product won’t fill their need. James read about how this fear can prevent a purchase. His response - counteract that fear by offering a return for any reason. You’ve seen this type of guarantee before. It isn’t unique. Any department store offers the same thing. But James didn’t stop there.\nJames has gone a step further. He is offering to pay for your part and return shipping costs. This is the kind of guarantee that keeps you awake at night. You might lose money on every single sale. The only company making any money would be Australia Post. But here’s where it gets better\nReturns are Hardly Asked For James says that he’s had so few returns that he’d be surprised if the total number was higher than five. That’s it. Five out of all the sales he’s made to date.\nGuarantees Increase Sales James has always offered an amazing guarantee. So we can’t contrast Master Parts’ sales before and after the guarantee. However, I’ve found one example that suggests a 20% increase in sales with a guarantee. You’ll agree that a 20% increase in sales isn’t a bad test outcome.\nYou’ll be in good company after mastering the art of the guarantee. Advertising greats David Ogilvy, Joe Sugarman and Claude Hopkins can all attribute part of their great fortune to the money back guarantee. But it won’t always be smooth sailing.\nReturns Still Hurt Each return still hurts even though it is infrequent. James’ secret is to take the returns with a happy face. He says that while you may not get rich from a single transaction, you can become poor if you don’t make a point of making every customer completely happy.\nAnd while returns do hurt - not every return is a sad story. A Master Parts customer ordered two related parts - a window regulator and a motor - then returned the part he didn’t use. The customer insisted on paying for postage himself and was completely delighted that the whole returns process was so easy.\nMaking a Guarantee for Your Business If you’d like to follow James’ example here are some things to bear in mind.\nJames said that his parts don’t spoil or suffer from being tried on. Knowing that you can re-stock the part makes for better peace of mind for James, but wouldn’t make sense for a wedding cake baker.\nThe type and wording of your guarantee will depend on your business. Those selling informational products like an e-book wouldn’t need to ask for return of the product or postage but would still offer a full refund. Brennan, the seller of this e-book about improving your freelance business offers a full refund and a 1 hour consultation.\n If my book doesn’t help you raise your rates, I’ll refund you 100% and offer you an hour consult to fix your freelancing business. You have nothing to lose (and I’d be on the hook for an hour of my time.)\n Writing a winning guarantee is impossible without understanding your customer and the nature of your business. James’ customers need to see the part without the fear of being stuck with something they don’t want. Brennan’s customers want to grow their freelance business, so his guarantee addresses that need.\nDoes your guarantee keep you up at night?\nIf you own a Porsche or a MINI or want to say thanks, say hi to James at Master Parts.\n","description":"","tags":["interview"],"title":"Insomnia Sells","uri":"/insomnia-sells/"},{"content":"Does this page sell? I constantly experiment to increase leads and sales from my web pages. In this article you’ll learn the method I use to critically analyse web pages and take concrete steps to increase your sales.\nThe 6 Persuasive Principles Robert Cialdini wrote about 6 principles that persuade us. I’ve used those 6 principles to develop a process for analysing the persuasiveness of any sales page. And you can use this process yourself. Not only will it tell you how persuasive your sales page is. It will also tell you how to improve your level of persuasion. Read on to find out how.\nBriefly, Robert’s 6 persuasive principles are:\n Reciprocation - We want to reciprocate when given something for free Consistency/commitment - We want to been seen as rational humans, and will often do strange things to be seen as keeping our word. Getting a person to verbally or in writing take some small action will support a much larger stance in that direction in the future. Liking - We are drawn to and trust other people that seem like (similar to) us. Scarcity - We want what we can’t have or is difficult to get Authority - We often trust someone in a police outfit even if they aren’t a policeman Social Proof - It is well known now that we use the wisdom of the crowd to help make decisions  As a side note, Robert’s book Influence expands on each of these principles in extreme depth with plenty of entertaining examples. Pick up a copy from your library - plenty of actionable advice - you won’t be disappointed.\nHow to rank your web page I’ve translated the 6 principles into a repeatable process that will help you:\n Rank your pages consistently; and Put your sales through the roof.  But you must take action. Reading about the process won’t get you anything, you must use the process on your own website if you want to see results.\n The Persuasion Rank Tool\n Write the names of each of Cialdini’s 6 principles down the page.\nAnd for each principle, we’ll score the web page (one page at a time in isolation) from 0 to 2.\n A 0 means that this principle isn’t really used on the page A 1 means that you can see the principle is used; and A 2 means that it has been used well.  You’ll read through your web page, giving each principle a score. At the end, your tally will indicate whether you need to improve the site and in which areas.\nApply this rank per web page Avoid the temptation to give yourself credit if a principle exists somewhere else on your site but not this page. For example, if you have a testimonials page, you can’t count that social proof towards your homepage. It exists only on the testimonials page which would get a solid 2 whereas your home page may have none and get a 0 for social proof.\nSee this principle in action I’ll use this process to rank the FreshBooks website. FreshBooks is a kind of online bookkeeping and invoicing system for businesses. Their target market would be the owners and CFOs of small to medium sized companies.\nHere is their website www.freshbooks.com\nReciprocation - 0 The “Try It Free” offer could trigger the reciprocation principle. But do you really feel like you are getting something for free - especially considering the freebie lasts only 30 days? No.. me either.\nConsistency and Commitment - 0 There isn’t anything to give someone the feeling that they’ve made a commitment. They could add a small check-box that says something like “Yes I want to focus on my work not my paperwork” above the sign up button. Having it automatically checked could trigger this commitment principle.\nLiking - 2 They have one section on their page for accountants. An accountant browsing the site will see the link and feel comfortable knowing that they are in the right place.\nAnother section states:\n Take a minute to learn how we’re in your corner\n Though they are a huge company, no longer a small business. They’ve made an effort to close the distance between us and them, by stating they are in our corner.\nScarcity - 0 There isn’t any mention of scarcity on this page. The copy doesn’t imply that FreshBooks memberships are in any way a scarce resource. From time to time I am sure they do use this principle. Such as for a limited time sale and with invite only sign up during beta.\nAuthority - 2 They frequently mention the number of customers and invoices that have been issued. They also promote their featured status in some high profile publications like CNN, Forbes and CPA.\n If you stacked all the invoices that FreshBooks has sent, it would stand taller than the CN Tower.\n and\n Join over 5 million people using FreshBooks to make billing painless.\n and\n Number 1 Cloud Accounting Specialist for Small Business Owners.\n They assert their market dominance and authority on the subject of invoicing and bookkeeping. Not a lot of startups can do that. If you are a small business you’ll need to be more creative in your use of authority. You could show a tweet about you from a high profile company and use authority symbols such as trust seals.\nSocial Proof - 2 FreshBooks knock this one out of the park. And rightly so, it is such a powerful principle to apply. They have rotating quotes with photos from their users and magazine articles.\nTotal score - 6 FreshBooks’ total score is high, they’ve applied a number of the principles very well. It is difficult to score consistently high for every principle. Don’t be disheartened, use this FreshBooks score as a benchmark when you are ranking your own site.\nGet the 6 principles now I know some of you will be interested in getting a copy of the tool I use to rank web pages. I’ll personally email a copy to your address when you put your name in the form on the right →.\nAnd, if you want me to look over your site and rank it with you just email me back and ask.

But branding does impact your business revenue. Here is a story about how the correct brand will pull you out of the sales wilderness, send your customer engagement levels through the roof and put you on the path to success.\nDivert to Mobile’s story begins in 2006 Steve built his own customised phone system to scratch his own itch. He reaped the benefits of his custom built phone system for the following three years. Never once did it occur to him that he should form a business around this phone system until one day in 2009.\nSteve had just dropped his wife off at a course and was madly rushing back to the office so he could get back to consulting work. But on the way he realised that his business calls would be delivered to his mobile anyway - thanks to the customised phone system. It was while reflecting on his phone diverting system that Steve realised that he “should redesign my phone system as a product and sell it” so that other business owners could have the same freedom.\nGetting Your First Customers Long before Divert to Mobile, Steve had IT consulting gigs with a few clients. They became his first customers. He asked them all “Why was it that you signed up?” and found that they really wanted a landline number for their business. Armed with that critical piece of information - what customers really want - he tried his hand at direct mail advertising and printed 1000 flyers. It worked. The orders came in. Steve had a repeatable process for getting new business using direct mail.\nBranding Is An Important Part of Your Success Steve says the hardest part for new companies is education and awareness. When you start out, customers don’t know about you at all (awareness of you is zero) and if they do find you, they don’t know what you do.\nSteve’s first company iteration used a brand (not the current Divert to Mobile brand) which didn’t really communicate the product and what it could do for the customer. Accordingly his awareness remained low and educating potential customers about the product was very difficult.\nOne and a half years in, Steve decided on a re-brand. This time he built it around his core product: Divert to Mobile. The rebrand has measureably improved both company awareness (through Google searches) and educating potential customers. Now it is immediately clear to customers how Divert to Mobile could help them.\nMake Life Easy On Yourself: Develop A Brand Don’t do business the hard way. Develop a brand that says what your company can do for your customer. You will work less for every sale because your brand is building your awareness and educating customers - even while you sleep.\nAbout Divert to Mobile Small business can advertise a landline number but receive calls to their mobile. Steve’s customers are from a wide range of industries:\n Plumbers use it because they didn’t want to be talked down on price by customers with their direct mobile number Virtual Assistants use it so that every client has a unique landline, but the assistant need only answer a single phone Teachers use it as a disposable number so that students can call without learning their personal mobile phone number; and Steve himself uses it so that business calls are put through during the day and to a voice mail message (which is emailed as an mp3 file) at night.

Is paying Google for traffic the best strategy for you and what can you can do if it isn’t?\nTurning $20k of advertising into $5k of sales Evan and Walker together started teespring. It’s Kickstarter for T-shirts. Someone proposes a design and asks 50+ friends if they would like to buy it. If they get 50+ orders, the T-shirts are printed and shipped. Otherwise, nothing gets made and no one loses any money.\nEvan and Walker talked to Andrew Warner in this mixergy interview about teespring. They said that they believed their product was what people needed. Both disliked sales, but loved writing code. They thought that Google would do the selling for them. Their strategy was simple:\n Buy advertising on Google People visit the website; and Wait for the cheques to roll in.  They were a little more sophisticated than that though. Evan and Walker monitored their campaign and began to optimise and tweak the keywords and ad text to increase their conversion rates.\nUnfortunately for them, the cheques didn’t roll in. In fact they spent almost $20k on advertising and got $5k of sales.\nRecognise that you’re not winning Evan and Walker realised that Google ads (SEM or Search engine marketing) weren’t working for them. So they were forced to take action. How would you realise that SEM wasn’t working for you. Do you have a deliberate methodology in place so that you are aware of how well your ads are performing? And how early would you find out that something wasn’t going right?\nA changed direction - cold calling They knew from experience that emails and cold calling people made sales. But they were so reluctant to call potential customers on the phone. In fact they dreaded the “sales call”, it was an awkward situation that they didn’t want to be in. They knew that sales calls worked for them and still avoided them. Why?\nThey didn’t like sales calls because it didn’t fit with their personality. They preferred to write code, and optimise adwords to an awkward conversation on the phone with a stranger. Are there areas of your business that you avoid because it is awkward?\nHow to overcome the awkwardness Walker hired an intern who loved talking to strangers on the phone, and it immediately made a difference. In the first month, the intern managed to double sales. Why? Because he wasn’t afraid of picking up the phone and making 30-40 calls a day to strangers. His personality fit perfectly. How can you ensure your awkward tasks get done, while still focussing on your business?\nIs SEM a good fit for your business? SEM is a great tool for a lot of businesses. Particularly ones in established niches. But teespring wasn’t in an established niche. No one was searching for “a Kickstarter for T-shirts”. Your business may fit this profile too. You are a young company trying to establish yourselves in a new market. Perhaps no one is searching for your kind of business yet! SEM wont work for you.\nYou know the right thing to do Paul Graham talks about the concept of schlep in business. He defines it as tasks that we don’t want to do. Doing these tasks will scale and grow your company, but because of our “schlep blindness” you don’t do those things.\nYou know what is right for your business. It may be attending conferences, making phone calls, advertising in print or making deals with affiliates. You know these tactics work for you, but still don’t want to do them. Follow Walker’s example. Hire someone that is good in this area (even an intern) and measure the results.\n","description":"","tags":["startup","marketing"],"title":"Whitley’s blog","uri":"/"},{"content":"Hi, thanks for visiting my blog.\nI’m an electrical engineer, who writes the software behind SweetProcess.\nFeel free to contact me about it.\nThe theme for this blog was inspired by Mr. Ian Brunelli, and uses the hugo blogging engine.\n Click Here (please) to make jerviswhitley.com your homepage.\n  var messages = [ \" \", \" \", \"Please stop.\", \"Did it not work?\", \"Now we'll meet every time you open the browser.\", \"It is an honour to be your portal.\", \"I'm so pleased you'd even consider doing that.\" ]; var link = document.getElementById(\"homepage\"); link.onclick = function(e) { e.preventDefault(); if (messages.length) { var parent = e.target.parentNode; var p = document.createElement('p'); p.innerHTML = messages.pop(); parent.append(p); } return false; }   ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"/about/"}]
